# Data Science for Launching Rockets

This is the capstone project I had to develop in order to get approved in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
It consists of predictive analysis in order to predict whether a rocket will land succesfully or not. 
The analysis is done by using Python programming language, and combines great technologies such as SQL, API's and IBM Cloud resources.
